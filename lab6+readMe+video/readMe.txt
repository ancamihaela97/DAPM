For this lab, we read carefully all the instructions and the course material from the website.
    We didn't encounter any problems while solving this lab.  We understood the use of Shared Prefferences and
 how we can save and retrieve data using it.Also we saw how we can pass data from one activity to another using putExtra().
    For the exercise 7 we simply added a random String to the method putExtra() and we retrieved that information in the
    second activity by using:
        Intent i = getIntent()
        name = i.getStringExtra("name");
    and a second TextView to show the info.
    Our application runs perfectly. We uploaded a video as a demo where we save first save the word Something
and show it to the second activity. After we write the word nothing we didn't press at first save to show that “something” is still saved
in the preferences. Also the text passed with putExtra is always showing in the second activity.
    Again we used TeamViewer and shared screen to complete this lab together.
