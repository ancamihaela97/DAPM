EX.2     For this lab I followed the steps in the tutorial and I succeded to implement the Ionic app. As an editor I used Visual Studio Code. I encountered a small problem when I run the first command in the terminal because I did not have the .NET framework SDK. After I installed a few things it finally worked and I could follow the next steps. I learned about using Ionic and how easy it is to  create a Photo Gallery app which lets you take pictures and also displays them. I attached a couple of screenshots with my app and also the source code.
