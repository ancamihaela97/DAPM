    For this lab, we read carefully all the instructions and the course material from the website.
    The only difficulty encountered was the implementation of 3 out of 4 methods because the methods were generated automatically
we didn't see what needs to be modified at first. But once we saw that, we modified quickly and the code was working instantly.
    Regarding the exercise 5, the code from the lab was not efficient because it creates new objects every time. In order to make it
efficiently we added an if statement to recycle the code (convertView object).
    We had no problems running the tutorial and we understood better the use of BaseAdaptor and its implementation with ListViews or GridLayout.
    Our application runs perfectly.
    Because of the quarantine we used TeamViewer and shared screen to complete this lab together.
